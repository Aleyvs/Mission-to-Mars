# Mission-to-Mars

# Overview 

This project aims to generate a web app where all the info about mars is scraped and stored. For this challenge we were asked add all four of the martian hemisphere images using Beautiful Soup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars' hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accomodate the images.
